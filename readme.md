# Awesome Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving

This is a repository for collecting resources about **multi-agent autonomous driving (MAAD)**. Different from single-agent autonomous driving which mainly focus on enhancing the driving capabilities of a single vehicle, MAAD focuses on the collaboration and interaction between multiple agents including vehicles and infrastructure.
